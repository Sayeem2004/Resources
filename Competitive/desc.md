# Competitive Programming

## Introduction

This section contains resources useful to competitive programming, a section of computer science related to algorithmic problem solving under time constraints.

## Description

### [Competitive Programmer's Handbook](cph.pdf)

A textbook-like resource that goes through many of the main topics of competitive programming starting from a short introduction of C++ and then going through data structures, algorithms, and math.

### [Principles of Algorithmic Problem Solving](paps.pdf)

Another textbook-like resource that goes through less topics than the Competitive Programmer's Handbook but goes into more depth on each topic and provides more implementation details with C++.
